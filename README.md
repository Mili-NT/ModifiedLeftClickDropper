# Modified Left Click Dropper
This plugin is a modified version of JZomDev's excellent left click dropper plug-in found [here](https://github.com/JZomDev/zom-external-plugins/tree/leftclick-dropper).

It functions identically to the original, allowing you to type in a list of item names to set the left click option to drop for, however I added basic wildcard support for item names. This feature was requested several times on the original, but is currently not planned for implementation as a design choice.

Example: typing in *seed would enable left click drop for Watermelon seed, Ranarr seed, Strawberry seed, etc.
